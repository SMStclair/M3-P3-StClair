# Project 3 - Module 3: Employ Matplotlib and matplotlib.pyplot
### by Sean StClair
This repository is my attempt at Project 3 for Web Mining and Applied NLP, where I will be using primarily Matplotlib and pyplot to answer questions and create charts with objectives.
## Matplotlib and pyplot

Complete the tasks in the Python Notebook in this repository.
To be submitted for credit, all changes must be committed and pushed to this repository (do not create your own repository unless instructed to on the course website).

### Rubric

Each question is worth two points: 

* Data plotted as described by the question (1 pt)
* Plot contains required elements (title, axis labels, axis titles, legend if required)

## Key Libraries Used

- **Matplotlib**: Used for all data visualizations in this assignment.
- **Random**: Used to generate random numbers for visualizations.
